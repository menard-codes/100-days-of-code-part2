# 100 Days of Code (Part 2)

Welcome! Thanks for stopping-by.

If you're in this repo, I'm gonna assume you might be curious about my journey throughout this challenge. Or perhaps you're finding some inspirations for your own 100 days of code challenge. Whatever your reason is, I hope you find what you're looking for in this repo.

## A little background about me and this challenge

Hello there!

I'm Menard.

I'm a self-taught dev and I'm re-considering taking this 100 Days of Code Challenge.

I already tried and finished this challenge back in 2021, and it literally changed my life. This challenge helped me get my first developer job (halfway through the challenge) whilst still in college.

I'll never forget that moment...

Anyway, I decided to retake this challenge because after more than a year of taking a break from work, I noticed I'm getting rusty on programming. I took that whole year to recover from burnout after I pushed myself way more than my limits. Another reason (and my main motivation) as to why I'm retaking this challenge is to strengthen my foundational knowledge in web development. Specifically CSS (and to some extent, JavaScript).

CSS is always a problem to me, so I decided to take the time to really be good at it as it's the only thing that's holding me down on my career. That being said, I'll focus on becoming good at the front-end by building projects using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Timeframe

- **Start Date:** April 4, 2023 (Tuesday)
- **End Date:** July 13, 2023 (Thursday)

## Goals

- [ ] Learn CSS in-depth
- [ ] Build my front-end portfolio by building projects (with platforms like Front-end Mentor, etc.)
- [ ] Improve my JavaScript skills
- [ ] Learn SASS
- [ ] Contribute to open source
- [ ] Learn TypeScript
- [ ] Relearn React.js and get more in-depth
- [ ] Relearn Next.js and get more in-depth (especially v13 and later)
- [ ] Setting-up my dev environment (dot files)
